# Dogs-vs-cats
 
 ## Introduction
 
This is a PyTorch implementation of Kaggle Competition Dataset Dogs vs. Cats. Its a basic classification problem solved using traditional CNNs.
 
 ## Dataset
 
 For raw dataset, follow this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
 It contains roughly 25,000 images of dogs and cats
 
 ## Scripts used
 
 * __data_load.py__ - Loads the data and applies the required transform if needed
 * __model.py__ - Basic CNN architecture for running the neural network
 * __cats-and-dogs.ipynb__ - Main Jupyter notebook for performing classification task

## Future scope

Various approaches can be adopted to improve the performance of the existing network. Few of the improvements are *__transfer learning, making the network more dense, using data augmentation methods__*, and many more.
